# Columbia Undergraduate (Barnard, CC, GS) Computer Science Major

This repository outlines the courses I am taking and plan to take to fulfill my requirements for the CS major at Columbia University, starting from the Fall 2024 semester. It also shares useful resources I have used and intend to use in these classes.

Available CS courses are listed [here](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/), along with the textbooks used in some of them. Generally, if you search for a course, professor, and "Columbia," you'll find a wealth of public resources.

For guidance on the CS major, refer to this [guide](https://github.com/mdzhang/columbia-cs-resources/blob/master/Guide.xls). Note that the requirements changed in Spring 2024, and the updated ones are posted [here](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BA.pdf).

You can find [class-specific resources](https://github.com/mdzhang/columbia-cs-resources/tree/master/resources) that may not be available online.

If you are a transfer student, this [PDF](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/adam+/QgrcJHsHkKlMmLGSTWqVgrbNdTpTnwdcTJl?projector=1&messagePartId=0.1) will be highly useful.

As a CS major, you will be required to take several math classes to strengthen your mathematical thinking and foundation.
